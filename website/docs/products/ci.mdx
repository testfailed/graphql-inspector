GraphQL Inspector can be used with any Continuous Integration. It's easy!

## Installation

GraphQL Inspector already has CLI, but we developed a more suited approach for consuming it in CI/CD.
It's called CLI for CI.

Install it using:

<PackageInstall global packages="@graphql-inspector/ci" />

You need to install `graphql` globally too:

<PackageInstall global packages="graphql" />

Most common use case is schema diffing and all the other features are never touched. That's why we decide to **make each feature pluggable**.

In GraphQLI Inspector CLI for CI, you're able to **install exactly what you want to use**. **Each command is an installable package**.

## Commands

Here's a list of available command. Pick one or few.

| Command                            | Package                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `graphql-inspector diff ...`       | `@graphql-inspector/diff-command`       |
| `graphql-inspector validate ...`   | `@graphql-inspector/validate-command`   |
| `graphql-inspector coverage ...`   | `@graphql-inspector/coverage-command`   |
| `graphql-inspector similar ...`    | `@graphql-inspector/similar-command`    |
| `graphql-inspector introspect ...` | `@graphql-inspector/introspect-command` |
| `graphql-inspector serve ...`      | `@graphql-inspector/serve-command`      |

## Loaders

"Loader" is a fairly new concept. Since each command is a package, we decided to do the same for schema/document loading logic.

Depending on the source of GraphQL Schema or GraphQL Documents, pick one or few from the list.

| Input                                    | Package                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `.graphql`, `.gql` and similar           | `@graphql-inspector/graphql-loader` |
| `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.vue` and similar | `@graphql-inspector/code-loader`    |
| introspection result `.json`             | `@graphql-inspector/json-loader`    |
| File in Git repository                   | `@graphql-inspector/git-loader`     |
| File on GitHub                           | `@graphql-inspector/github-loader`  |
| GraphQL Endpoint                         | `@graphql-inspector/url-loader`     |

Now you know where everything is but let's find out how to make a use of it.

## Usage

Let's take for example Schema Diffing and assume your latest `schema.graphql` is under `master` branch.

You want to compare two GraphQL Schemas:

<PackageInstall global packages="@graphql-inspector/diff-command" />

You need to be able to load `schema.graphql` from disk and from `origin/master` on Git:

<PackageInstall global packages="@graphql-inspector/graphql-loader @graphql-inspector/git-loader" />

With everything installed, you can use the command below in your CI setup:

    graphql-inspector diff 'git:origin/master:./schema.graphql' 'schema.graphql'

## Example

Now, when you push your changes you would see the following:

![Schema Diff in CircleCI](/assets/img/ci/diff.jpg)

> Remember, you can use any command the CLI offers.

## Recommended workflow

We recommend to automate the workflow and use `husky` to run [`$ graphql-inspector introspect`](../essentials/introspect).

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "graphql:dump": "graphql-inspector introspect schema.js --write schema.graphql"
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "yarn graphql:dump && git add schema.graphql"
    }
  }
}
```

This way your `schema.graphql` is always in sync with the code, on each commit.

## Using Docker image

You can use GraphQL Inspector Docker image in any CI/CD provider. For example, in CircleCI it would look like this:

```yaml
# Inside the .circleci/config.yml file:
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: GraphQL Inspector
          command: 'graphql-inspector diff "git:origin/master:./schema.graphql" "schema.graphql"'
```
