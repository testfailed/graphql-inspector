title: What is GraphQL Inspector?
---

GraphQL Inspector is a set of tools to help you better maintain and improve GraphQL API as well as GraphQL consumers.

GraphQL Inspector outputs a list of changes between two GraphQL schemas. Every change is precisely explained and marked as breaking, non-breaking or dangerous. It will help you validate documents and fragments against a schema and even find similar or duplicated types.

**Use GraphQL Inspector however you like:**

- **Command Line Tool**
- [**GitHub Application**](./products/github)
- [**GitHub Action**](./products/action)
- **Programmatic API**

The way GraphQL Inspector is built enables you to use everything through a CLI or each feature separately using one of many available packages. There's also a GitHub Application that you can install and use within seconds. If you're fan of GitHub Actions, we got you covered too.

## GitHub Application and Action

> GraphQL Application is open-sourced, we host it so you don't have to.

## Command Line Tool

  <source src="/assets/img/cli/demo.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/assets/img/cli/demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

> GraphQL Inspector has a **CLI** and also a **programmatic API**, so you can use it however you want to and even build tools on top of it.
